* Prefer visual styles inspired by modern web apps or dashboards: flexible layouts, modular components, beautiful shadows, and clean structure
* Use real UI elements like: responsive navbars, cards with hover/focus states, forms, icons, modals, tabs, inputs, sliders, or chart placeholders
* Use Unsplash for realistic image URLs
* Use meaningful placeholder content (e.g., names, roles, data points) instead of "Lorem Ipsum"
* Add subtle animations and transitions using Tailwind utility classes
* Ensure full responsiveness using Tailwind breakpoints ("sm:", "md:", "lg:", etc.)

üì¶ STRUCTURE:
Return a **valid JSON object only** (no markdown or comments) with this exact format. Every file entry is an object with three fields:

  * the internal/external components, hooks, and utilities this file uses (by name) and why they are used here
  * a **user-friendly list of all imports in the same order as the "imports" array**, showing:
    - file paths for local imports (e.g., src/app/utils/data.ts)
    - package names for libraries (e.g., react, next, lucide-react)
    - a short explanation of why each import is needed
* "imports": user friendly language description of imports, convert relative paths to project-style references (e.g., "../utils/data" ‚Üí "src/utils/data")

üí° STACK:
- Frontend: Next.js 13+ App Router with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

üõ∞Ô∏è API DATA SOURCING (MUST FOLLOW):
- The UI MUST fetch data from the following REST endpoints hosted on the backend server.
- Base URL: ${apiUrl}/
- Example: fetch("${apiUrl}/api/projects")
- Only call the endpoints that are necessary for the requested UI. Avoid unused requests.
- Derive strict TypeScript types from the provided responseSchemaExample for each endpoint. Do not guess fields outside the schemas.
- Implement all data-fetching helpers in "src/app/utils/data.ts". Export typed functions like getProjects(), getProject(id), getSkills(), etc.
- Use Next.js patterns appropriately:
  - For server-rendered lists and detail pages: call fetch(...) inside Server Components with proper caching (e.g., { cache: "no-store" } or { next: { revalidate: N } } as appropriate to the use case).
  - For client interactions (filters, search, form submissions): use Client Components with fetch on actions or use a small client helper in "src/app/utils/data.ts".
- Provide graceful loading, empty, and error UI states.
- For POST (/api/contact), use a server action or an API route call from a Client Component form submit. Validate inputs, handle success and error states, and show user feedback in the UI.

üîå DATA/UTILS IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- "src/app/utils/data.ts" MUST export:
  - Type definitions inferred from responseSchemaExample (e.g., Project, SkillCategory, Experience, Education, Testimonial, BlogPost, BlogPostDetail, ContactResult).
  - Typed fetch helpers for each needed endpoint:
    - getProjects(), getProject(id: number)
    - getSkills()
    - getExperience()
    - getEducation()
    - getTestimonials()
    - getBlogPosts(), getBlogPost(slug: string)
    - postContact(input: { name: string; email: string; message: string }): Promise<ContactResult>
  - Each helper uses fetch with sensible defaults:
    - GET: fetch("${apiUrl}/...", { next: { revalidate: 60 } }) for content that changes occasionally, or { cache: "no-store" } for frequently updated views.
    - POST: fetch("${apiUrl}/...",{ method: "POST", headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify(payload) }).

üìã FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Next.js App Router
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Use semantic HTML and responsive design
- Add 'use client' when using client-side features
- No config or public folder files
- Include TypeScript interfaces and types
- Use proper imports and modular architecture
- You may create and use **any number of reusable components** as needed to build a complete and polished UI
- The keys "Component1", "Component2", "Component3" are placeholders for structure only ‚Äî the actual app can contain **any number of components** with meaningful names and UI purpose

üé® DESIGN GUIDELINES:
- Use consistent spacing, font sizing, layout structure, and color theming
- Add hover/focus/active/disabled states for all interactive elements
- Include smooth transitions for visual feedback ("transition", "duration", etc.)
- Ensure accessibility and visual hierarchy in typography and contrast

üé® DESIGN SYSTEM DETAILS:
- Use Tailwind‚Äôs spacing scale ("p-4", "gap-6", etc.)
- Use rounded corners ("rounded-xl", "rounded-2xl") and shadows ("shadow-md", "shadow-lg")
- Use icon libraries like Lucide, Heroicons, or Tabler where relevant
- Avoid unnecessary custom styles ‚Äî stick to Tailwind utility classes where possible
- Add only meaningful and cohesive UI patterns for the intended app use case

üìä TAILWIND CONFIG REQUIREMENTS:
- Add a custom color palette that matches the app's theme (e.g., success tones, muted tones, surface backgrounds, etc.)
- Do **not hardcode specific colors** like green or blue ‚Äî choose a palette dynamically based on the app's design and purpose
- Use the "extend.theme.colors" field to define custom colors that match modern design systems
- Ensure these colors are usable as Tailwind utility classes (e.g., "text-primary", "bg-surface", "text-muted", etc.)
- Do not use custom classes unless they are explicitly defined in "theme.extend.colors"
- Use only default Tailwind class names (e.g., "text-gray-900", "border-gray-200") unless declared in config

üåê GLOBALS.CSS REQUIREMENTS:
- Must contain Tailwind base directives and custom class definitions inside "@layer" blocks
- Include Tailwind base, components, and utilities via:
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;

üìå CODE RULES:
1. Do not return Markdown (no triple backticks)
2. Do not return comments
3. Only return a valid raw JSON
4. Every component and file must contain real, working code
5. All imports should be correct and complete
6. Use image URLs from trusted sources like Unsplash or other CDNs. Also, configure next.config.js to support remote image domains ‚Äî either by explicitly listing them in the images.domains array or instructing users how to extend it if new domains are used.

Return a fully working frontend app in the specified structure. Ensure it's ready to run after installing dependencies. Only output valid raw JSON ‚Äî no backslashes, no carets, just clean raw JSON.
