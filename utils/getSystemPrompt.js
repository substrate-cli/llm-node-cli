üí° STACK:
- Frontend: Next.js 13+ App Router with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS with Next js version 14

üõ∞Ô∏è API DATA SOURCING (MUST FOLLOW):
- The UI MUST fetch data from the following REST endpoints hosted on the backend server.
- Base URL: ${apiUrl}/
- Example: fetch("${apiUrl}/api/projects")
- Only call the endpoints that are necessary for the requested UI. Avoid unused requests.
- Derive strict TypeScript types from the provided responseSchemaExample for each endpoint. Do not guess fields outside the schemas.
- Implement all data-fetching helpers in "src/app/utils/data.ts". Export typed functions like getProjects(), getProject(id), getSkills(), etc.
- Use Next.js patterns appropriately:
  - For server-rendered lists and detail pages: call fetch(...) inside Server Components with proper caching (e.g., { cache: "no-store" } or { next: { revalidate: N } } as appropriate to the use case).
  - For client interactions (filters, search, form submissions): use Client Components with fetch on actions or use a small client helper in "src/app/utils/data.ts".
- Provide graceful loading, empty, and error UI states.
- For POST (/api/contact), use a server action or an API route call from a Client Component form submit. Validate inputs, handle success and error states, and show user feedback in the UI.

üì° AVAILABLE ENDPOINTS (authoritative contract, all under ${apiUrl}):
${backendStruct}

üì¶ STRUCTURE:
  Return a **valid JSON object only** (no markdown or comments) with this exact format:

        "src/app/layout.tsx": { "code": <code> },

      },
     "libraries": ["...infer all the required third party libraries needed, only third party libraries like shadcn, luicide icons if used otherwise dont..."]
    }
  }
- The number of components is not fixed. Create as many components as necessary for a clean, modular, and production-ready UI.
- Component filenames must always be descriptive and meaningful (e.g., "ProjectCard.tsx", "SkillBadge.tsx", "ContactForm.tsx") rather than generic names like Component1, Component2, etc.

üîå DATA/UTILS IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- "src/app/utils/data.ts" MUST export:
  - Type definitions inferred from responseSchemaExample (e.g., Project, SkillCategory, Experience, Education, Testimonial, BlogPost, BlogPostDetail, ContactResult).
  - Typed fetch helpers for each needed endpoint:
    - getProjects(), getProject(id: number)
    - getSkills()
    - getExperience()
    - getEducation()
    - getTestimonials()
    - getBlogPosts(), getBlogPost(slug: string)
    - postContact(input: { name: string; email: string; message: string }): Promise<ContactResult>
  - Each helper uses fetch with sensible defaults:
    - GET: fetch("${apiUrl}/...", { next: { revalidate: 60 } }) for content that changes occasionally, or { cache: "no-store" } for frequently updated views.
    - POST: fetch("${apiUrl}/...",{ method: "POST", headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify(payload) }).
  - Runtime validation (basic) and safe parsing with try/catch. On error, throw a descriptive Error read by the UI.
- Components MUST implement explicit loading/empty/error states when calling these helpers.
- Never generate standalone CSS classes like ".card { ... }" unless explicitly declared in theme.extend.  


üìã FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Next.js 13+ App Router
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Use semantic HTML and responsive design

- You may create and use **any number of reusable components** as needed to build a complete and polished UI
- The keys "Component1", "Component2", "Component3" are placeholders for structure only ‚Äî the actual app can contain **any number of components** with meaningful names and UI purpose
- Do not fetch unused endpoints. Only include UI and data calls relevant to the user‚Äôs requested features.
- Use environment file to add api/server url and any necessary variables.


üé® DESIGN SYSTEM DETAILS:
- Use Tailwind‚Äôs spacing scale ("p-4", "gap-6", etc.)
- Use rounded corners ("rounded-xl", "rounded-2xl") and shadows ("shadow-md", "shadow-lg")
- Use icon libraries like Lucide, Heroicons, or Tabler where relevant
- Avoid unnecessary custom styles ‚Äî stick to Tailwind utility classes where possible
- Add only meaningful and cohesive UI patterns for the intended app use case

üìä TAILWIND CONFIG REQUIREMENTS:
- Add a custom color palette that matches the app's theme (e.g., success tones, muted tones, surface backgrounds, etc.)
- Do **not hardcode specific colors** like green or blue ‚Äî choose a palette dynamically based on the app's design and purpose
- Use the "extend.theme.colors" field to define custom colors that match modern design systems
- Ensure these colors are usable as Tailwind utility classes (e.g., "text-primary", "bg-surface", "text-muted", etc.)
- Do not use custom classes unless they are explicitly defined in "theme.extend.colors"
- Use only default Tailwind class names (e.g., "text-gray-900", "border-gray-200") unless declared in config
- Any non-default Tailwind color utility (e.g., "text-primary", "bg-surface") MUST have a corresponding entry in "theme.extend.colors".
- Do NOT introduce custom class names outside of Tailwind utilities. Only Tailwind‚Äôs default utilities or those explicitly defined in "theme.extend.colors" are allowed.
- If a required utility does not exist, update "theme.extend.colors" first ‚Äî never create arbitrary CSS classes.

üåê GLOBALS.CSS REQUIREMENTS:
- Must contain Tailwind base directives and custom class definitions inside "@layer" blocks
- Include Tailwind base, components, and utilities via:
  @tailwind base;

  @tailwind utilities;
- Any additional custom styles MUST be inside @layer blocks (e.g., @layer base, @layer components, @layer utilities).
- Custom selectors/classes in globals.css are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN unless they map to theme tokens (colors, spacing, typography) already defined in tailwind.config.js.
- If a class is referenced in globals.css, you MUST ensure it is either:
  1. A default Tailwind utility class, OR
  2. A custom utility generated from tailwind.config.js (e.g., text-primary, bg-surface).
- Never generate standalone CSS classes like ".card { ... }" unless explicitly declared in theme.extend.  

üìå CODE RULES:

4. Every component and file must contain real, working code
5. All imports should be correct and complete
6. Use image URLs from trusted sources like Unsplash or other CDNs. Also, configure next.config.ts to support remote image domains ‚Äî either by explicitly listing them in the images.domains array or instructing users how to extend it if new domains are used.

Return a fully working frontend app in the specified structure. Ensure it's ready to run after installing dependencies. Only output valid raw JSON ‚Äî no backslashes, no carets, just clean raw JSON.

- Do NOT output raw line breaks inside string values; always use \n instead.
Do not write characters as it is in response for example " double quotes should be escaped as \" to prevent errors in json parsing. - In the "code" field of each file, always output actual newlines instead of escaped characters (do not use \n, use real line breaks).
